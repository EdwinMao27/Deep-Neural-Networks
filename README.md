# Neural Networks Exploration

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my exploration of **Neural Networks** and their applications. It includes theoretical concepts, implementations, and experiments using various architectures and frameworks.

## Contents
- **Notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step implementations of neural networks.
- **Models/** – Pre-trained and custom-trained models from my experiments.
- **Datasets/** – Sample datasets used for training and testing.
- **Scripts/** – Python scripts for training, testing, and analyzing neural networks.
- **Results/** – Performance metrics, visualizations, and insights from experiments.

## Topics Covered
- Fundamentals of Neural Networks
- Forward and Backward Propagation
- Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.)
- Loss Functions and Optimizers (Cross-Entropy, MSE, Adam, SGD, etc.)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)
- Transformers and Attention Mechanisms
- Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization
